# Double_Snes_Controller_Mister
PCB to use Two snes controller on MISTER fpga


This is PCB to hold two SNES controller connectors using the Arduino Pro micro firmware by MickGyver. This lets you use wires or wireless SNES controllers for MISTER FPGA.


You will need an Arduino Pro Micro and Two SNES controller connectors.  Straight or Right angle connectors are totally fine. It's a beginner friendly project to assemble. 


There are mounting holes on 3 points on PCB.  I would just use nylon plastic support screws but you could possible 3D print a case for this.


To order PCB please go to gerber folder and download the ZIP file and take it to a recommended PCB manufacturer such as JLCPCB.
